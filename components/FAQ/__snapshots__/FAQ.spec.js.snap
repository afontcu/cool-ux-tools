    why did you do this?
  </h3>
  <p class="u-margin-bottom-large">
    Why not? There's a lot of cool resources out there and I needed a place to gather them. I had my own Google Sheet file, and I wanted
    to share it in a comfortable way. So here we are.

    aren't you a frontend engineer?
  </h3>
  <p class="u-margin-bottom-large">
    Yes I am! But lines are blurry and sometimes I need to step into the realm of UX, for which I feel myself more insufficient.
    This is why I explored a lot of tools, to understand what were trying to solve and why.

    my tool/resource/whatever isn't listed and it's cooler than you
  </h3>
  <p class="u-margin-bottom-large">
    Yeap, that's possible. Sorry to hear. I listed the tools I knew and I liked, so if yours isn't there, it's probably because
    (1) I didn't know about it or (2) other tools were cooler than yours. But I'm almost always wrong, so it must be reason #1.
